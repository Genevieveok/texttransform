# texttransform

`texttransform` is a simple Python tool designed to:
- Convert sentences to uppercase or lowercase.
- Properly format sentences by capitalizing the first letter of each sentence and handling ellipses correctly.

This tool was developed as a learning exercise to explore how to package Python scripts into downloadable executables that others can use. Additionally, itâ€™s a handy solution for those times when I accidentally type entire paragraphs in uppercase before realizing I've made a major text blunder.


## Features
- **Convert**: Change text to uppercase or lowercase.
- **Format**: Properly capitalize sentences and handle ellipses.
